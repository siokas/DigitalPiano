There is a \"Start Accelerator\" button which starts the sensor and an\r\ninput field to enter the ip of the server. If the server's ip is correct, up and running and the sensor\r\nis taking values of the x axis, the app makes a connection with the server and sends the x values\r\nin an absolute format (because if you tilt the device to the right, the x axis takes negative values). \r\n\r\n`SensorManager sensorManager = (SensorManager) getSystemService(SENSOR_SERVICE);`<br><br>\r\n`List<Sensor> sensors = sensorManager.getSensorList(Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER);`\r\n\r\n### Processing app\r\nThe Processing app is a simple server which forwards to the Arduino (using the Serial connection) the values. It creates a small window and starts the server socket waiting for incoming connections. If \r\nthere is a connection, the app prints the ip of the client and forwards the incoming message to the \r\nSerial connection (in which the Arduino is connected). \r\n\r\n### Arduino app\r\nThe Arduino app takes the values from the Serial connection and depending to these values sends the corresponding note (pitch) to the connected speaker. The incoming values are between 0 and 9 and\r\nthe Arduino app plays different note depending on theses values.\r\n\r\n### Arduino Circuit\r\nTo play music with your Arduino you need to have: an Arduino (any type), a breadboard (not necessary), \r\na speaker and some breadboard wires. You have to connect the one cable of speaker to an Arduino\r\npin and the other to the Ground.\r\n\r\n![Arduino](https://raw.github.com/solotsopa/DigitalPiano/master/Arduino/DigitalPiano/arduino.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Troubleshooting\r\nIn the Processing code you have to change the Serial port list to the one which is connects your\r\nComputer with the Arduino. Change the _mySerialPortList_\r\n\r\n`int mySerialPortList = 0; `<br><br>\r\n`String portName = Serial.list()[mySerialPortList]; `\r\n\r\nIn Arduino app code you have to change the pin to the one which you have connected the speaker in the\r\nArduino.\r\n\r\n`int pin = 12;` \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAndroid and Processing app are designed and programmed by Apostolos Siokas (@solotsopa)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor everything you can reach me at apostolossiokas@gmail.com","google":"UA-28752364-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
